========

#### R Package for clustering via EM algorithm
emclustr is a package for finite mixture modeling via EM
algorithm. Its main extensions to the "mclust" package are (1) mixture
modeling non-Gaussian distributed data, and (2) mixture modeling for
Gaussian distributed data with missing values

#### Repo Notes
Sept 2015 - version 0.2
June 2014 - version 0.1
Jan 2015 -- NOTE: I plan to completely re-write this in the spring 2015 using library(mvnnorm) and add data augmentation algorithms. V0.1 is essentially a very raw alpha version.
